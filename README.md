# Solstice Contacts
Solstice Coding Assesment 
Web App for viewing a list of contacts from an endpoint - React / Axios (networking lib) / HTML/CSS/JS / Semantic UI 

I ended up opting to write this app in React so there was a bit of a learning curve early on to pick up a new technology. Youtube videos helped get of the ground.
